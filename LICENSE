% Compiling this template:
% This template uses biber for its bibliography and makeindex for its index.
% When you first open the template, compile it from the command line with the 
% commands below to make sure your LaTeX distribution is configured correctly:
%
% 1) pdflatex main
% 2) makeindex main.idx -s StyleInd.ist
% 3) biber main
% 4) pdflatex main x 2
%
% After this, when you wish to update the bibliography/index use the appropriate
% command above and make sure to compile with pdflatex several times 
% afterwards to propagate your changes to the document.
%
% This template also uses a number of packages which may need to be
% updated to the newest versions for the template to compile. It is strongly
% recommended you update your LaTeX distribution if you have any
% compilation errors.

% Important note:

% e.g. 920px width and 460px height.
